# Normative Obligation Network Theory (NONT)

This repository contains the full LaTeX source for the paper:

**"Normative Obligation Network Theory (NONT): A Relational Model of Agency in Moral Space"**  
_A formal and conceptual framework for modeling moral agents as nodes in a network of directed obligations._

---

## 📖 Overview

**NONT** proposes a new way to think about moral agency—not as a self-contained bearer of duties and rights, but as a node embedded in a dynamic network of obligations. The model draws on insights from:

- Deontic logic
- Graph and network theory
- Metaethics and relational ethics (e.g. Scanlon, Darwall, care ethics)

Using elementary mathematics, NONT visualizes the moral structure of agents and makes relational asymmetries explicit and analytically tractable.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Agents as Nodes**: Each moral agent is a node in a directed graph.
- **Obligations as Edges**: A directed edge from A to B represents A’s obligation to B.
- **Normative State**: The net balance of incoming and outgoing obligations.
- **Equilibrium and Injustice**: The model allows us to theorize about fairness, power asymmetries, and moral repair.
