_A formal and conceptual framework for modeling moral agents as nodes in a network of directed obligations._

## üìñ Overview

**NONT** proposes a new way to think about moral agency‚Äînot as a self-contained bearer of duties and rights, but as a node embedded in a dynamic network of obligations. The model draws on insights from:

- Deontic logic
- Graph and network theory
- Metaethics and relational ethics (e.g. Scanlon, Darwall, care ethics)

Using elementary mathematics, NONT visualizes the moral structure of agents and makes relational asymmetries explicit and analytically tractable.
